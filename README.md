# tensorflow-docker


## why 
Official repo 's docker image only supply a version from ubuntu:16.04, and ubuntu:16.04 the default python version is 3.5.

If you want to use python 3.6, there is no way to do with the docker image.

Nvidia supply the latest ubuntu:18.04 docker image, so we can make tensorflow by own.


## how
from 18.04 nvidia docker image
add more tips when build a docker image in china.
